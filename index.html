           <p> Australia have become the first team to announce their preliminary squad for the upcoming ICC men’s ODI World Cup 2023 which gets underway in India in October. Top Test batter Marnus Labuschagne has failed to make the cut in a side which includes uncapped India-origin leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha and Western Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie.

            Cricket Australia named an extended 18-man squad for the ODI World Cup 2023 that will later be trimmed to 15, with a five-match series in South Africa in September the first assignment. Selectors also named a new-look T20 squad with a strong Big Bash League (BBL) flavour for three matches in South Africa before the ODI World Cup 2023 build-up begins, with big names rested from the shortest format ahead of a gruelling one-day campaign.
            
            Labuschagne is the most notable omission from the 50-over squad having played 30 of Australia’s 38 matches since his debut in January 2020, with an average of 31.37.
